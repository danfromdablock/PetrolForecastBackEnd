## Features
- Forecast production rates using Exponential, Hyperbolic, and Harmonic models.
- Support for single decline models and two-period models.
- Plot forecasts using Matplotlib and Plotly.
- Save forecast results to an Excel file.
- Upload production data via a Flask web interface.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
